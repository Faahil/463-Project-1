# Time-Series Clustering and Segment Analysis on PulseDB Using Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms

**Author:** Faahil Ali  
**Course:** CMPSC 463 — Project 1

## Description of Project

This project clusters and analyzes short biomedical time-series segments from the PulseDB dataset using plain algorithms rather than machine learning. The focus is on ten second Arterial Blood Pressure segments. The pipeline loads the data, normalizes each segment, groups similar segments using a divide and conquer strategy, checks cluster cohesion by finding the most similar pair inside each cluster, and highlights the most active interval within each segment using Kadane’s algorithm on the first difference. The goal is to show that straightforward algorithmic reasoning can produce clear and explainable results on physiological signals without relying on heavy libraries.



## Installation and Usage

### Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Packages: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `h5py`
  
The code runs with Python version 3.10 or newer and needs `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `h5py`. After installing these packages with pip install -r requirements.txt, open the file named `Ali – CMPSC 463 – Project 1.py` in your editor and set the `DataPath` variable to the location of your VitalDB mat file. For example you can set DataPath to 
```python 
C:\Users\faa32\Downloads\VitalDB_CalBased_Test_Subset.mat.
```
Save the file and run it from a terminal with python `Ali - CMPSC 463 – Project 1.py`. The program prints a short summary of clusters, closest pair distances, and Kadane intervals, and it opens one or two simple plots that overlay the closest pair in a cluster with the active windows shaded. If you want to verify the algorithms without a dataset, set `ShowToyCheck` to True and run the script to see a small synthetic demo.

## Structure of Code

Everything is in a single file called `Ali – CMPSC 463 – Project 1.py`. The data is loaded and trimmed by `LoadAbpSegmentsFromMat` which reads ABP from the Subset group inside the mat file and makes sure every segment has the same length. `NormalizeSegments` performs a z score per segment so that distance calculations are fair. The program measures similarity with correlation distance by default and also includes a simple DTW option for small tests. The divide and conquer clustering is implemented by `SplitCluster`, `RecursiveCluster`, and `RunClustering` which repeatedly split groups until they reach size or depth limits. Inside each final cluster the function `FindClosestPair` searches for the most similar pair which is used as a quick cohesion check and as a representative example. To find where a signal is most active the code runs Kadane on the first difference using Kadane and `GetActivePart`. `ShowClusters` produces quick matplotlib plots that overlay the closest pair and shade the active regions. Small `dataclasses` named `Cluster`, `PairInfo`, and `KadaneOutput` keep results tidy and readable.

### Class Summaries
`Cluster` stores the indices of the signals that belong to a final cluster.  
`PairInfo` holds the pair of indices inside a cluster that are most similar, plus their distance.  
`KadaneOutput` records the start index, end index, and sum for the maximum subarray on the first difference of a signal.

## Description of Algorithms

The divide and conquer clustering starts with all segments in one group. It chooses two seeds that are far apart and assigns every segment to the seed it is closer to. It then recurses on each side until the groups are small enough or a maximum recursion depth is reached. The closest pair search inside each cluster compares all pairs and keeps the minimum distance which serves as a simple cohesion measure and helps pick a representative pair. Kadane’s algorithm runs on the first difference of each segment and returns the contiguous interval with the largest cumulative change. This interval often aligns with physiologically meaningful events such as sharp upstrokes or strong peaks in ABP, which helps explain why certain segments belong together.

## Verification with Toy Example

The project includes a small toy mode that fabricates a few short signals such as sinusoids with slight phase shifts, a faster sinusoid, a scaled version, a flat signal, and a copy with a brief spike. Running the pipeline on this set shows that the divide and conquer split places similar shapes together, the closest pair is chosen sensibly, and Kadane highlights the expected high activity region on the spiky signal. This quick check confirms that the implementation behaves sensibly before using the real dataset.

## Execution Results with 1000 Time Series

When run on up to one thousand ABP segments of about six hundred twenty five samples each, the program loads and normalizes the data, performs the recursive clustering using correlation distance, and forms roughly twenty or more clusters depending on the distribution. The console prints a table for the first few clusters that includes mean, minimum, and maximum intra cluster distances which offers a quick view of cohesion. It also prints a few Kadane intervals for sample segments and shows one or two plots with the closest pair overlaid and active spans shaded. Typical output begins with a message similar to Loaded 1000 segments with 625 samples each followed by a line such as Made 22 clusters and a short list of example cluster sizes. These results show that the approach runs quickly and produces interpretable groups.

## Discussion on Execution Results

The clusters line up well with the visual appearance of the waveforms. Segments that share similar ABP shapes tend to land in the same group, and the smallest pair distances inside those groups are low which supports cluster cohesion. The activity windows found by Kadane usually align with fast rises and peaks which helps explain the grouping. Correlation distance is fast and works well when heartbeats are roughly aligned. DTW is available but slower and is best reserved for smaller trials. The main limitations are the simple two seed split which can create uneven groups in some edge cases and a basic stopping rule that uses fixed size and depth rather than an adaptive score. Future improvements could add a silhouette style stopping rule, better seeding, and optional support for other signals such as ECG or PPG.

## Conclusions

This project shows that a straightforward algorithmic pipeline can cluster and explain biomedical time-series data without any machine learning. Divide and conquer clustering groups similar segments, the closest pair search provides an easy cohesion check and a clear example to inspect, and Kadane highlights where each signal is most active. The system is simple, fast, and easy to understand which makes it a solid demonstration of classical algorithms applied to real physiological data.
